 * @property {ImageData} image Sets a second image to use on the right of the dialog, and slightly up. This field expects an `ImageData` object.
 * @property {number} typeSpeed The text appears one character at a time, simulating typing. Players can click to skip the animation. Tune the speed of this typing (30 by default) to go slower or faster. Set to _-1_ to skip the animation.
